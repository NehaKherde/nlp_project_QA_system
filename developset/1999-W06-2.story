HEADLINE: A Sad Groundhog Day

TEXT:

Wiarton Willie, the famous Canadian groundhog who predicted the arrival
of spring, died
in his sleep of natural causes on Sunday, two days before Groundhog's
Day.

His death was kept secret until today when a crowd gathered for Willie's
annual prediction.

"We didn't really know what to do," said Sam Brouwer, who was been the
rodent's caretaker over the last 10 years. "We were absolutely
devastated."

Willie was placed in a pine coffin for public viewing. His paws were
crossed, his eyelids had pennies on them and he held a carrot. Brouwer
said Willie was 22 years old, which is three times longer than the
average age a groundhog survives in the wild. He will be buried in the
spring.

But Willie did make one more prediction.

Al Given, mayor of South Bruce Peninsula, said that Willie's spirit told
him that it would be an early spring.

A search will begin to find Willie's son, who will take over Willie's
duties
and home -- a hutch in the front yard of a motel south of Wiarton.
Wiarton Willie had done the job over the
last decade. If the sun was shining when Willie peeked his head out, it
meant six more weeks of cold weather. If it was cloudy, Willie couldn't
see his shadow, which meant spring would come early.

Punxsutawney Phil, another famous groundhog who lives in Pennsylvania,
did not see his shadow
this morning.
