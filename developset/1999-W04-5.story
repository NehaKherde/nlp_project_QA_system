TEXT:

Ever heard the expression "don't look a gift horse in the mouth?" It
means not to be too critical if you get something for free.

Well, that is exactly what the federal government is doing concerning a
million dollar gift to the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, Ontario.  And
it appears the government does not like what it has found. To continue
the metaphor, it look like this horse has some major dental problems.

The government has been looking at a charitable donation by Ottawa
Senators hockey star Alexi Yashin. Earlier this year he promised to give
one million dollars to the National Arts Centre, a concert hall where
people go to see plays and dance and to hear live music. 

Many Canadians were delighted to see that Alexi Yashin was donating so
much money. Mr. Yashin makes a salary of more than three million dollars
a season. It is very expensive to put on live performances and the
National Arts Centre has recently had to raise ticket prices and cut
back on performances because of a lack of funds.

It was the most famous donation ever to the National Arts Centre. Mr.
Yashin's popularity soared.

But then this week Mr. Yashin's donation turned sour.

After giving the Centre $200,000 Alexi Yashin made an about face. He
decided not to give the other $800,000 he had promised.

He says his decision was for personal reasons. But it now looks like
Alexi Yashin was not really being honest.
It seems he actually changed his mind because federal Auditor General
Denis Desautels told him he was trying to break the law.

Mr. Yashin originally announced he was a lover of the arts. He said that
as a well paid hockey player he wanted to help the National Arts Centre
put on new performances. But behind the scenes his plan was not to give
the Arts Centre one million dollars.

Instead, in a secret agreement, the National Arts Centre would have
hired Mr. Yashin's parents at $85,000 a year. They would have been paid
out of Alexi Yashin's yearly $200,000 donation. What's more, his parents
would not have to actually work.

This was a way for Alexi Yashin to give money to his parents while
illegally saving thousands of dollars in taxes. 

As well, a lawyer working for Mr. Yashin was to get $15,000 out of the
remaining $115,000.

So in fact the million dollar donation would really only be half of
that.

It would have been a great public relations victory. Mr. Yashin would
look like he was being very generous. But behind the scenes he was
really much less so.

Yesterday evening the Ottawa Senators were playing in Boston. After the
game reporters went to the locker room to ask Alexi Yashin what was
going on. But he refused to talk to reporters about his "personal
reasons" for
cancelling his donation.

He said simply that "I know I didn't do anything illegal. I know I
didn't do anything wrong. I can't control what they say. It's a free
country."

He also said he wanted to focus on hockey and nothing else. The other
players and coach of the Ottawa Senators would not comment either. They
said it was Alexi's personal affair and not important to them.

Many Ottawa-area hockey fans are deeply disappointed with what is going
on.

"People here are puzzled. They feel let down," says Rick Soweita, who
owns a sports bar. "He benefited from the publicity and now he's got to
own up."
