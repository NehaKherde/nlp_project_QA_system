Canada's 
minister of health has announced a new plan to try to discourage teenagers from 
smoking: The Yuck Factor. The government wants to put graphic pictures and warnings 
on all cigarette packages. 
Allan Rock said yesterday that he's convinced the labels will work. But many of 
the young smokers he's targeting aren't so sure. The warnings cover half of each 
side of a cigarette package. There are 16 messages and images, including pictures 
of diseased lungs.

Teenage smokers 
at a high school in Ottawa say some of the warnings are funny, but others, like 
an image showing a mouth full of rotting teeth, are disturbing and may make them 
think twice.

"I have to say this 
one with the teeth is quite disgusting. And I'm sure it will discourage a few 
smokers from starting up anyway," said one of the teens.

But a 17-year-old 
smoker said he knows all about the dangers of his habit and new warnings won't 
make him quit.

"If you smoke, you 
know what's going to happen to you. Just seeing it a warning label is going to 
gross you out every time you take a cigarette. It's not really going to stop you."

But Rock believes 
the warnings will make a difference. He says his department has done extensive 
surveys and he thinks the labels will be effective.

"Our testing, our 
focus groups and our surveys demonstrated that the old style warnings are losing 
their force. It's important for us now to take fresh steps and that's what we're 
doing today."

Anti-smoking organizations 
have applauded the strategy. The Non-Smokers Rights Association says the labels 
will give people a graphic reminder of the harmful effects of smoking a cigarette.

But the plan has 
a very powerful enemy. The tobacco industry is considering whether it should take 
the government to court.

The Canadian Tobacco 
Manufacturers Association, which represents tobacco companies, says it would take 
two years and cost millions of dollars to change the packaging on Canadian cigarettes. 
Spokesman Rob Parker is convinced the warnings won't work.

"They're still doing 
the same old thing, yelling even louder at smokers to quit or non-smokers not 
to start. It hasn't worked," says Mr. Parker.

The minister says 
he hopes to have the new cigarette packages on store shelves by the end of the 
year. He says tobacco companies that don't comply won't be selling their product 
in Canada.
